What happened to my version of the readme file?
# InstantChurch Directory
This project will attempt to extract data from a csv file that was created using InstantChurchDirectory.  The csv file contains a list of familys with all of their contact information (phone numbers, emails, postal address, etc.).

# Tooling
This project uses Python 3.9 and Pandas dataframes.  I developed it using VS Code and the Juypter Notebooks extension.

# Other Things I learned
I created a virtual environment using the following commands:
  * python3 -m venv venv  (where the 2nd venv is the name of the environment)
  * venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1  (Powershell script to activate the environment)
  * deactivate (switch back to the global environment)

I also set up a requirements.tx file using the following command:
  * pip freeze > requirements.txt
